The company provided a dataset with over 9 million unique observations for 19 different variables across different vehicle units. Using this dataset, we developed a method to predict system failure with Signal Processing and Machine Learning techniques (CNN). The predictive model yielded outstanding results (0.95 accuracy score on test data) and can be utilized commercially as an early detection mechanism for system failure. "

I also implemented saving the checkpoints so that you can continue training if stopped. Image Classifier predicts 102 flower categories. "
